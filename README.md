# Class Activity 2


##Task 1

Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called even.py.
● Write a program that asks the user to enter a number.
● Make use of the while loop repetition structure so the program prints out
all the even numbers from 1 up to (and possibly including) the number
given by the user.
● Compile, save, and run your file.

##Task 2

Follow these steps:
● Create a program called names.py to do the following:
o Require the user to enter the names of all pupils in a class. The user
should be able to type “Stop” to indicate that the names of all the
students have been entered.
o Print out the total number of names the users entered after the
loop has been exited.
● Compile, save, and run your file.

##Task 3

Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called while.py.
● Write a program that always asks the user to enter a number.
● When the user enters -1, the program should stop requesting the user to
enter a number,
● The program must then calculate the average of the numbers entered,
excluding the -1.
● Make use of the while loop repetition structure to implement the
program.
● Compile, save, and run your file.

##Task 4 

Follow these steps: 
● Create a program file called task1.py. 
● This program needs to make use of for loops in order to display the times tables for any number. 
● For example, say the user enters 6 - the program must print out the 6 times table from start (1) to end (12), something like this: The 6 times table is: 6 x 1 = 6 6 x 2 = 12 … 6 x 12 = 72 
● Compile, save, and run your file.  

##Task 5

Follow these steps: 
A simple rule to determine if a year is a leap year is to test if it is a multiple of 4. 
● Create a program file called task2.py. 
● In this file, write a program to input a year and a number of years. 
● Then use for loops to determine and display which of those years were or will be leap years. What year do you want to start with? 1994 How many years do you want to check? 8 1994 isn’t a leap year 1995 isn’t a leap year 1996 is a leap year 1997 isn’t a leap year 1998 isn’t a leap year 1999 isn’t a leap year 2000 is a leap year 2001 isn’t a leap year 
● Compile, save and run your file.  

##Task 6

Follow these steps: 
● Create a new Python file in this folder called task3.py. 
● The activities in this task are all different and are designed to test your knowledge of loops, including a little while-loop revision. 
● Create a while loop that will display count down from 20 to 0. 
● Next, create a loop (any) that will display all the even numbers between 1 and 20. 
● Now, create a loop that will produce the following output: * ** *** **** ***** 
● Finally, write the code to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD, or highest common factor) of two positive integers.
